### User Story

AS AN avid traveller  
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection  
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling  

### Business Context  

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

### Acceptance Criteria  
GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection  
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit  
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.  

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.
